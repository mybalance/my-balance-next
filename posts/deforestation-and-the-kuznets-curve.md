As countries become richer, both politicians and the public tend to care more about the environment. 

So goes the economic theory known as the Kuznets curve. Named for the economist Simon Kuznets, the Kuznets curve, when applied to the environment, states that as a country begins to develop economically, the environment will worsen, but, once a threshold has been reached, the environment will begin to drastically improve.

The Kuznets curve predicts that once countries reach a per capita GDP of $4,600, net deforestation will cease. Countries that have yet to reach this threshold, of course, will still experience deforestation to one degree or another. 

While this prediction has been broadly true in a variety of states around the world, it is not true in every case.

In Brazil, for example, deforestation recently hit its highest level for 15 years. Brazil’s GDP per capita is nearly $6,800.

Many environmental groups have criticised Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, for anti-environment policies.         

Indeed, over the last twenty years, Brazil has lost roughly 26 million hectares of tropical primary forest. 

However, as the Kuznets curve would predict, many of the richer regions of the world are increasing their total forest area. What’s more, many wealthy countries have more forest area now than they did before industrialization. 

In the last 100 years, for example, the UK has roughly tripled its total forest area. 

This is not to say that the overall picture is rosy. Between 2000 and 2015, data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation show that the world has gained 4.3 million hectares of forest per year while losing 7.6 million hectares of forest per year. 

While the difference between these two figures certainly seems striking on first glance, the actual reduction of global forest area per year is 0.08 percent. Again, this figure ought to be going in the opposite direction, but, thankfully, we’re not going to run out of forests just yet.

And if global GDP trends continue to go in the right direction, we won’t run out of forests at all. A 2017 study at the University of Helsinki noted that forest area increased in wealthy and middle-income nations and reduced in poorer nations. 

According to the study, from 1990 to 2015, wealthy nations increased their forest cover by 1.31 percent; middle-income nations increased their forest cover by 0.5 percent; and poor nations decreased their forest cover by 0.72 percent.

We see the Kuznets curve in action here, and, what’s more, we see that people tend to care much more about their environment as they become richer. 

This, put simply, is very good news. Over the course of the 21t century, global extreme poverty continues to rapidly decline. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as an individual living on less than $1.90 per day.  

As global poverty continues this trend throughout the course of the 21st century, individuals, families, and communities, free of the pressures of poverty, will spend more time on environmental concerns. 

Or, to put it another way, as the world grows richer, it will grow greener.

Which is a pretty good Christmas message, all things considered. 

Merry Christmas!
