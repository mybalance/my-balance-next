Over the past couple of weeks we’ve experienced some absolutely baking heat here in the UK. And since most of us don’t have air conditioning units in our homes, there has been little respite from the often overwhelming weather.

While air conditioning isn’t required for most of the year, we Brits can surely appreciate why most of our American friends live in air conditioned homes.

Working from home in 30 degree heat is rather challenging.

However, it could’ve been worse. Earlier this month, the US National Weather Service recorded scorching temperatures of over 54 degrees at the appropriately named Furnace Creek in Death Valley. This might prove to be the highest reliably recorded temperature on earth.

Marginally warmer temperatures were recorded over 100 years ago, but the inaccuracy of the equipment used to record these temperatures calls these readings into doubt.

Record heat waves have also been recently recorded in Canada, Europe, and Russia. Commenting on these records, Jonathan Watts writes in the Guardian: “the severity of the hot spell has underlined the dangerous impact of human-caused climate disruption and prompted scientists to consider whether computer models may have underestimated the impacts.”

Heat waves like this certainly aren’t unheard of in the UK, but record heat waves across the globe are a cause for concern for many climate scientists. Indeed, the French Council of State, the highest administrative court in the country, at the beginning of July ordered the French government to take more steps to combat the climate crisis.

What’s more, Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, has urged the UK government to further regulate business and finance in order to tackle climate change.

And according to Nikos Christidis, a climate scientist at the Met Office, the question isn’t if climate change has an effect on these heat waves; rather, the question is how much climate change has an effect on these heat waves.

Says Christidis: “Our study suggests that currently this region could expect an event of this magnitude every 15 years or so on average, with that level rising to almost every year under some future scenarios.”

Without rapid reductions in global emissions, these heat waves are likely to happen more often. Indeed, the Met Office predicts that by 2050, the UK could see heat waves like the one we are currently enduring every couple of years.

The Met Office also reports that the average hottest day of the year has increased by 0.8 degrees since the early 60s and that warm spells have more than doubled in length, from 5.3 days to 13.2 days, since the early 60s.

Keep an eye on the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference, which is set to take place in Glasgow in November, for policy announcements from leaders whose countries are most responsible for carbon emissions.

And, most importantly, remember your sunscreen.
