On 20 May, the X-Press Pearl container ship, registered in Singapore, caught fire off the coast of Sri Lanka, roughly between the cities of Negombo and Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital.

Greenpeace reported that the vessel caught fire “following a leak of nitric acid from a container which is thought to have triggered a chemical reaction in the cargo. This caused a fire which eventually made the ship a total constructive loss.”

By 30 May, the fire had been extinguished, but the damage to the ship had already been done. Eight containers containing tiny plastic pellets roughly the size of lentils -- called nurdles -- fell overboard. These pellets then spread with the currents of the water.

The ship itself, now a wreck, lies half sunken off the coast. Its hull is resting on the shallow ocean floor.

This will undoubtedly be one of the worst environmental disasters in the country’s history.

The X-Press Pearl disaster highlights the terrible costs of environmental damage, with polluted waters, desecrated beaches, and human livelihoods devastated by the ship’s destruction.

One particularly troublesome aspect of the disaster is the nurdles that have been scattered into the waters, some of which will eventually wash up onto Sri Lanka’s beaches. These tiny pellets are used in nearly all plastic goods to one degree or another.

What’s more, nurdles have been found in the gills and bellies of washed-up fish.

While sailors from Sri Lanka’s navy have been working to remove the nurdles -- and other waste and debris -- from the beaches near Negombo and Colombo, the wreck’s effect on the broader ecosystem is already underway.

The chemical pollution from the wreck will likely last for decades, meaning that fish sourced from the area will be dangerous for humans for years. The Sri Lankan government has already banned fishing in the affected waters, leaving fishing communities in Negombo and Colombo teetering on the edge.

The shipping company that operates the X-Press Pearl, X-Press Feeders, has commissioned a third party to respond to the incident, noting that its specialists are already on the ground in the country, but efforts to tow the stricken vessel into deeper waters have already failed.

Container shipping is an essential aspect of the global economy -- the recent blockage of the Suez Canal cost roughly 9.6 billion dollars a day according to Lloyd’s List -- but the X-Press Pearl disaster highlights just how susceptible our oceans are to even the contents of one vessel.

The clean-up effort will no doubt take time, and the local environment will take years to recover, with both human communities and animal habitats severely affected by this disaster.
