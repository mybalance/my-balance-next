The world is heating, and humans are responsible for at least some of it, but we shouldn’t panic.

Much of the modern debate around climate change involves people who are clearly passionate and knowledgeable about their subject acting rather rudely to other people who are clearly passionate and knowledgeable about their subject.

Or, to put it another way, we’re quite bad at listening to one another.

There are, of course, a number of reasons for this – human nature being one of the most important – but social media also has a significant role to play.

Many people who are far more intelligent and well-read than I have said some very interesting and important things about the social media phenomenon, so I won’t wax lyrical about the subject here.

However, I will emphasise that the ability to see one’s opponents on the issue of climate as simple avatars on a screen rather than flesh-and-blood people isn’t at all useful for treating them with respect and dignity.

In the spirit of treating people with respect and dignity – as well as not panicking – I’d like to highlight the work of a couple of writers who are very much worth reading when it comes to the issues of humans and the planet: Matt Ridley and Bjorn Lomborg.

Ridley, author of How Innovation Works, argues that, while there is certainly some cause for concern, human innovation and ingenuity will be the most potent weapon against climate change.

Lomborg, author of False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet, argues that many of the measures that governments across the world are implementing will do very little to combat rising temperatures and will have serious repercussions in other areas of life and the economy.

Ridley and Lomborg are not naive. Both acknowledge the significant challenges that humanity must face in this century.

But any careful reading of either of these writer’s works will leave most readers more optimistic about the world in which we live. Such optimism would not be misplaced. It would, instead, be based on widely-available facts and data.

Which brings me back to the theme of this article. For those unfamiliar, the phrase “Don’t panic” comes from the 1979 novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams.

In the novel, Adams writes that the eponymous travel guide has the words “Don’t panic” printed in “large, friendly letters on the cover”.

The science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke said that “Don’t panic” is the best advice that one could give to humanity.

All things considered, it’s pretty good advice.

And I would argue that it certainly applies to the issue of climate change.

Yes, there are certainly well-meaning people who argue that in fact we should panic, that we should take drastic steps to combat the problems that we face. I must disagree.

In order to tackle climate change, we mustn’t panic. We should allow people, as Ridley argues, to be creative and innovative when it comes to solutions, and we should have sensible, respectful discussion in our political institutions to find practical policies that balance trade-offs appropriately.

There is no one solution. There is no silver bullet. Any one answer will have both positive aspects and negative aspects. It is the job of both political and private institutions to weigh up these aspects in order to arrive at the best solution.

And that isn’t easy. We’re all human, which means that we bring all sorts of biases and inconsistencies to these discussions. There’s no getting around this fact, so we should act accordingly.

And, above all, don’t panic.
