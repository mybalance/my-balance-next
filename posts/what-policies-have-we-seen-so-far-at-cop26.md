COP26 is in full swing over in Glasgow, and we’ve already seen a couple of interesting policy proposals from the event. 

The UK Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced yesterday that the Treasury would oblige UK listed companies and financial institutions to show how they will hit net-zero targets. 

A panel of experts, the Transition Plan Taskforce, would then scrutinise these plans in order to ensure that they are fit for purpose. 

However, implementing such plans would not be mandatory, which is at least one cause for concern for environmental groups, many of which have criticised the plans, saying that they do not go far enough.

In his speech in Glasgow yesterday, Sunak said that he wanted to “rewire the entire global financial system for net-zero”. Whether this proposal will kick start this process remains to be seen.

What other policy proposals have we got? The US and the EU have agreed by 2030 to cut the emission of methane gas by 30 percent compared to 2020 levels. 

Methane is responsible for roughly a third of human-caused warming. 

While this pledge alone isn’t sufficient to reduce the US and EU’s carbon to manageable levels, it is nonetheless a significant step on the way to doing so. 

Indeed, commenting on the policy, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that cutting methane is “one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming".

Experts believe, moreover, that cutting methane by 30 percent by 2030 would help the planet avoid .3 degrees of warming by 2040. And while .3 doesn’t sound like much, our target warming for this century is 1.5 degrees, so think of this figure as 20 percent, which is a decent chunk of what we need. 

Elsewhere, representatives from over 100 nations present in Glasgow have agreed to end and indeed to reverse deforestation by 2030. 

Over 85 percent of the planet’s forests are found in states whose leaders have signed the agreement, including the US, the UK, China, and Brazil. 

This is certainly a step in the right direction, but many onlookers will be cautious: a similar pledge was signed in 2014, the New York Declaration on Forests, and, clearly, it didn’t have the desired effect. 

However, far fewer governments signed up to this deal. In total, only 40 governments did so; Brazil was one of the states that did not agree to the pledge. 

After the third day of COP26, then, there has been some progress. And while there is plenty more to do and plenty more opportunities for disagreement, things appear to be moving in the right direction. 

Many activists will not be satisfied with these agreements, and with good reason. There is much more to do and much more to discuss. 

But we’re moving in the right direction.
