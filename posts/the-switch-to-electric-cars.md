Electric cars are the future of motoring. In the UK, in thirty years, probably less, petrol and diesel cars will be seen as relics of a past age. 

What’s more, a joint study from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen, and Cambridge predicts that by 2050 one in two cars will be electric across the world. Such a change would decrease carbon emissions by roughly 1.5 gigatonnes per year. 

And many car companies are along for the ride. GM aims to stop selling petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. Volvo aims to do so by 2030. And Jaguar aims to get there by 2025.  

However, getting from here to there isn’t a simple task. While the design and production of the electric car continues to improve, the real problem is the proliferation of fast, cheap, efficient charging points. 

When petrol and diesel cars started to gain popularity in the early 20th century, there were virtually no petrol stations, but, as the demand for the product grew, petrol stations began to appear across the country.

In order for electric cars to be a viable form of transport for most people, the same must happen with charging points. 

In one sense, the problem will be easier to solve: most homes will be fitted with a charging point. Owners will be able to charge their vehicles when they are at home.     

Installing a charging point on the driveway of a family home is one thing. Installing charging points for motorists who live in apartment buildings is another thing entirely.

What’s more, motorists in different countries have different requirements for their vehicles. For example, motorists living in the rural areas of some American states must be able to rely on their vehicles to do hundreds of miles on a regular basis. The same can be said for many Australians and Canadians. 

Not everyone lives in or near a big city, and our transportation infrastructure should recognise this reality. 

One of the reasons for the emerging popularity of the electric car is the success of Tesla. Elon Musk has made the electric vehicle cool. But, perhaps more importantly, electric cars are better for the environment.   

How much better for the environment is an electric car compared to a petrol or diesel car? The short answer: significantly. Electric cars are better for the environment than petrol and diesel cars to the tune of roughly 30 percent of lifetime emissions in the UK. In countries like France and Sweden, where most of the electric power comes from renewables and nuclear, that figure rises to 70 percent.

Electric vehicles aren’t emission free, then, but they are a better bet than petrol and diesel cars when it comes to environmental questions. 

And as our electric grid in the UK becomes more and more clean, that 30 percent will increase. The more we clean up the grid, the cleaner our electric vehicles become. 

More importantly, the quicker charging points proliferate around the country, the easier it will be for most motorists to make the switch. 

Electric cars are the future of motoring, but when exactly that future arrives is still up in the air.
