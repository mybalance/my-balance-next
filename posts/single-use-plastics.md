Our Modern systems we apply to food packaging provide us with food that can keep safe for us to eat for longer periods. The price for this extended life is high in environmental terms as most plastics being used are commonly single-use and as such not frequently recycled. A recent study suggested that in 30 years there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish, indeed the United Nations has recently declared the pollution of our oceans “a planetary crisis”.

As food packaging is the main use for single-use plastics it's worth having a closer look to see if there is more we should be doing to reduce its use, its no surprise that the answer is a huge yes with over 23 million tonnes of waste food packaging in Europe produced each year.

When you next shop, take a look at the fresh food isles; almost all the food we buy especially processed food that comes packaged. This packaging is in the main manufactured from synthetic materials and most use petroleum base. The position in 2010 was not great in that after 40 years of the universal recycling symbol being used across all packaging only 14% of plastic is collected for recycling, and then after selection, only 5% is truly recycled. Thankfully this figure is improving now with estimates exceeding 20% but that’s hardly great reading. It works out that for every single-use plastic bag we use and then chuck away an average car could travel 8 km with the same carbon footprint!

At the heart of it, we all want fresh food that both tastes good and is healthy for us, the trouble comes that the packaging we have adopted to deliver this uses lots of precise resources and produces high levels of carbon dioxide from the production. We have another dilemma here to consider from a carbon footprint perspective, plastic is very light when compared to say glass and therefore will use up far less energy in transporting, but when we do use it we mostly do not recycle and the plastic can find its way to our oceans. This is not an easy one to work through and it likely needs compromise as we simply don’t have a lot of choice in some cases.

All is not lost however in that we can make decisions between what we buy and how we treat our waste, we must all start targeting 100% recycling of all plastic and where we can look for products in glass containers as glass can be recycled indefinitely. To give us some context to the time it takes for things to biodegrade we could compare a cardboard carton with a 3-month biodegradable outcome to that of a plastic fizzy drink bottle with one of 450 years!! 

So what can you start doing today? We have pulled together a list of a few things you may wish to consider to help you reduce your dependence on plastic in your life.

- Shop with reusable bags, we are getting better around the world but 5 years ago it was estimated that up to 1 trillion bags were used each year!
- Can you buy cardboard rather than plastic, or even better glass and recycle everything.
- Avoid bottled water in those plastic bottles, refill.
- Why not drink your coffee when on the go from a reusable cup, over 500 billion single-use cups are thrown away every year around the world.
- Why not buy a bar of soap rather than plastic bottles with body wash, the latter requires 20 times more energy to package compared to the soap bar.
- Avoid buying clothes with plastic content; 85% of textiles end up in landfills.
- Do not use plastic cutlery anywhere — there is no need as with a little planning this can be avoided.
- If you need to wrap food (sandwiches, for example) use recyclable tin foil rather than cling film, or even better a sandwich box which may last a few years.
- Remove/reduce the use of gum, in the UK we consume on average 130 sticks per person per year, chewing gum contains plastics and is hardly ever recycled.
- Find your local food suppliers, butchers, fishmongers and the like, and bring your purchases home in paper packaging where you can.
- What happened to the local milk delivery? If you have one in your area, consider using glass milk bottles delivered and collected as these are close to zero carbon, then watch your grandparents’ reaction.

You may be surprised by the things that you can switch over with a little bit of planning, every decision will help so there’s no such thing as it's not going to have any impact.
