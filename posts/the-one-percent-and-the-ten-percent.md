Yesterday was the sixth day of COP26, and, so far, there are reasons to be relatively positive.

As we discussed in a previous article, a variety of countries have agreed to terms that make a strong start in the fight to get warming down to 1.5 degrees. 

However, Friday’s focus was on a younger generation of climate activists.

Indeed, activists marched yesterday in Glasgow on the Fridays for Future climate march. The march will culminate at George’s Square, at which point Greta Thunberg will address the crowds. 

Unsurprisingly, Thunberg was not kind to the ruling elite in her speech, and in the eyes of many climate activists, she has good reasons for her scorn. 

One of which might be a new report released yesterday that states that the carbon footprint of the richest one percent is currently 30 times that which it needs to be in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.

That the wealthiest people in the world produce the most carbon emissions will not come as a surprise to most climate activists, but the fact that the figure is 30 times higher than it should be might come as a surprise to many people. 

What’s more, the poorest 50 percent will continue to produce carbon below the level at which global heating can be maintained at manageable levels.

Put simply, the richest people produce significantly more carbon than the poorest. 

This fact certainly won’t be a surprise to anyone. The richest countries in the world produce the most carbon; the poorest countries produce the least. 

One of the global challenges of the 21st century is to make poor countries wealthy in a sustainable fashion that will keep warming to manageable levels. Fossil fuels aren’t the solution to that problem, but it’s not clear what the answer is.   

Moreover, the problem of the top 1 percent’s carbon isn’t limited to the usual suspects. Millionaires and billionaires are, of course, in the global one percent, but so too are individuals earning over $172,000, or just over £127,000, a year.

What’s more, people earning over $55,000, or just shy of £41,000, are in the top ten percent of global earners.      

The problem, therefore, is that when we talk about the global one percent or the global ten percent, we’re talking about many normal people in Western nations. We’re not only talking about people who own three or four homes and a superyacht. 

Again, making poor countries sustainably wealthy will be important in the 21st century, but so too will be dealing with the issue of reducing emissions in the developed world.  

We in the West are used to the luxuries of modern life, and most people will be unwilling to give up such luxuries in order to reduce their carbon footprint. Some will, of course, and some do, but most will not. 

How, then, can we reach a sustainable, low-carbon future in the West while maintaining modern standards of living? It’s a tough question, and one that will continue to beguile policy makers for the coming years.
