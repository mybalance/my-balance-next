Welcome to our first issue of low-carbon eating plans as MyBalance starts a regular programme of recipes to help you on your new food journey.

Starting with a simple introduction here looking at what you may need to change, and the effects you can make in your carbon footprint, we will help you shed a few Kg’s of carbon as you prepare and eat the food you love. Before we start to dive in with our recipes there are a few issues you may wish to consider when planning what you eat and when you eat it.

Eating seasonally is really important and makes so much sense -- why would you buy food food that has to be transported thousands of miles in refrigerated boxes when you can utilise exciting local ingredients that change with the seasons and will have a big impact on your carbon footprint? This is not about a complete diet change; for most of us it’s a gently transition into a new way to plan the cooking and use of the food that is available without all the high carbon packing around it.

Planning those few changes and enjoying tasty food also likely has a positive health impact, but we will leave that to people more qualified than us to comment upon.

The first thing many people about low carbon diets is that it’s all about changing to become a vegetarian/vegan, or total switch to organic only food produce. Fantastic if you can as it will have a good impact, but other changes sometimes quite small will help and it all adds up.

You may have seen ‘no meat Monday’s‘ in the press, as people start to develop new habits themselves we think that’s a great way of changing old food habits, and maybe you can join in with those already doing good.

Alongside the diet change we really must all take responsibility for our food waste, in the UK alonne it is estimated that over 9 million tonnes of food is simply thrown out every year. The carbon footprint of that waste food being estimated at 25 million tonnes -- a truly astounding amount of carbon produced from our waste food.

So let’s plan to eat in season, reduce our waste food to near zero and make a change in a few food habits. MyBalance will look to share low-carbon recipes over the coming weeks to help you get started.
