While once only available to the rich, over the past thirty years or so flying has become an affordable travel option for everyone.

The coronavirus pandemic has -- and continues to -- shake up the industry, but flights still remain a reasonable choice when it comes to price. 

Of course, for the discerning traveller, up-market options are always available, but the proliferation of low-cost, no-frills airlines have made a weekend getaway in Madrid or a short hop across the Channel an affordable option for most Brits. 

However, these cheap flights come at a cost. Flying affects the environment. 

Global aviation, including both passenger and freight travel and military operations, accounts for roughly 2.5 percent of all carbon emissions. In 2018, the latest year for which data are available, aviation produced 1.04 billion tonnes of carbon.

While 2.5 percent is quite a modest figure, only a very small percentage of people actually fly frequently. In the UK and the US, for example, roughly 50 percent of people fly in a given year, and roughly 15 percent of people fly regularly. 

This means that, as developing nations around the world continue to grow more wealthy, the number of people who fly will increase. That modest figure of 2.5 percent, therefore, will continue to increase as well. 

Indeed, mile for mile, flying is the most carbon-intensive way of getting around. For example, a return flight from London to Sydney produces a little over 5 tonnes of carbon emissions; a return flight from London to Los Angeles produces roughly 2.5 tonnes of carbon emissions. The average Brit has a carbon footprint of over 12 tonnes, so it’s easy to see how flying can significantly increase an individual’s footprint. 

In terms of the planet, then, that weekend break in Europe doesn’t look particularly rosy. However, while there is no doubt that flying has significant drawbacks, the positives are clear.

The affordable nature of modern air travel has allowed people to see more of the world while spending much less money. Indeed, budget-friendly air travel has made the world much smaller.

Bringing family over for a wedding or going to visit friends on the other side of the planet has never been easier or cheaper. Even now, as the UK continues to emerge from the shadow of covid, cheap-and-cheerful flights are still available. 

But should the planet-conscious traveller look for alternatives to flying? Simply put, if you’re interested in living a low carbon life, you should look for other forms of travel. 

Of course, avoiding traveling by plane isn’t always particularly practical. Indeed, flying is often the quickest option, and it’s usually pretty cheap as well.

Is there a solution to this problem?

Like anything in life, there is no solution; there are only trade-offs. 

In this case, the trade-off isn’t terrible. For example, if our planet-conscious traveller really fancies that trip to Bali, she could offset the emissions of her flight with a carbon offsetting scheme. 

Is this a perfect solution? Certainly not. Is it one that will, all things considered, make the best of a bad situation? Probably. 
These choices are up to the individual him or herself. Perhaps for this trip we take a little longer and go on the train, but perhaps for that trip we take the flight but offset our carbon.

Very few people expect us to stop flying altogether, but it’s reasonable to take a moment and consider the best travel option given your own circumstances.
