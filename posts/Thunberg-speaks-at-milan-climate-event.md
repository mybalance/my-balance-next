While climate activist Greta Thunberg probably didn’t mean to reference Baddiel and Skinner’s classic football anthem, she nonetheless referred to political efforts to fight climate change as “30 years of blah, blah, blah” at a recent event in Milan.

The Swede excoriated world leaders for their lack of action on climate change. Referring to net-zero commitments and the green economy, Thunberg said: “This is all we hear from our so-called leaders. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises.”

According to the UN, emissions are on track to rise by over 15 percent by 2030. In order to remain under the 1.5 degrees warming target, these emissions would instead have to halve.

The event in Milan, Youth 4 Climate, was attended by over 400 young people, including Thunberg. These delegates came together in order to form a response to ministers on the subject of rising temperatures. 

Thunberg will also meet the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi.

Italy’s climate minister, Roberto Cingolani, accepted Thunberg’s criticism. Speaking to the BBC, he said that “we have a serious problem. We were not credible in the past.”

Thunberg’s remarks in Milan are, of course, to be read with the context of COP26, which is due to take place in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November.

COP26 is the most important climate event to take place over the past few years, and with so much at stake, delegates will be buoyed by the release of a new report from the Energy Transitions Commission, which is a body made up of leaders and experts from the energy, finance, and climate sectors.

Adair Turner, the chair of the Energy Transition Commission, said that "the 1.5C threshold is absolutely technologically possible at costs which the global economy could easily absorb."

Turner added that “there are specific initiatives which could be taken in addition to the country's carbon cutting plans, which would get us there." 

One of the specific initiatives that Turner mentions is the gradual phasing out of petrol and diesel cars, replacing these cars with electric vehicles by 2035. The UK is, of course, on track to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

The report also discusses cuts in methane emissions; phasing out of coal-powered stations; decarbonising heavy industry, buildings, and transport; reinvigorating energy and resource efficiency; and halting deforestation and beginning reforestation.  

Many of these issues will be on the agenda at COP26.

Last Friday, 24 September, hundreds of thousands of people across 99 countries took part in a climate strike in order to demand more action in the run up to COP26. 

It is clear that climate action remains important for many people around the world, but whether these political wishes become concrete policies backed by legislation remains to be seen, but Greta Thunberg remains sceptical:

“They invite cherry-picked young people to meetings like this to pretend that they listen to us. But they clearly don’t listen to us. Our emissions are still rising. The science doesn’t lie.”
