The 26th Conference of the Parties, COP26, is an event attended by roughly 30,000 delegates from 197 countries across the world.

These heads of state and climate experts will attempt to agree coordinated action to combat climate change.

The UK will host COP26, with MP Alok Sharma the chair of the event. The conference itself will take place in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November. 

The focus of the conference will be to accelerate action towards the Paris Climate Accords, which oblige signatories to keep global temperature increases below 2 degrees, to increase the use of renewable energy, and to spend 100 billion dollars a year to help developing nations’ fight against climate change.

Many experts and analysts consider COP26 to be the most significant climate event since the Paris Climate Accords were signed in 2015. 
Whether concrete, actionable decisions will be made at the conference remains to be seen. While many commenters are sceptical that anything serious will come from the event, others are more optimistic that the delegates will be able to agree to make tangible changes.

At a UN general assembly meeting on Wednesday, Boris Johnson gave a speech in which he urged the global community to “grow up” and to “listen to the warnings of the scientists”. He also added that COP26 must be a “turning point for humanity”.

And there have recently been some tentative signs that the major global players are beginning to get the message.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently announced that the superpower would no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad. According to Global Energy Monitor, a US think tank, this could affect 44 power stations that have already been earmarked for Chinese state funding.

In order to reach global emissions targets, China must produce fewer emissions closer to home, of course, but this announcement is nonetheless a step in the right direction.

What’s more, the US president, Joe Biden, also made a promising announcement in the past few days. The US will double its financial commitment to climate aid, pledging 11.4 billion dollars annually by 2024.

Developed nations had pledged to commit 100 billion dollars to climate aid by 2020. While this figure wasn’t met, the US money will encourage other rich nations to spend more in order to reach this target.

The politics of global climate change are, of course, complicated, and COP26 doesn’t change this fact. It will always be difficult to get to an agreement on these issues.

But while Paris represented a significant step forward in the fight against climate change, it is possible that we look back at COP26 as an important turning point. Of course, only time will tell. But the clock is certainly ticking.
