According to the Climate Change Committee, the UK’s independent body on climate change, the government is running out of time to meet its “historic climate promises”.

An article on the CCC website states that “this defining year for the UK’s climate credentials has been marred by uncertainty and delay to a host of new climate strategies. Those that have emerged have too often missed the mark. With every month of inaction, it is harder for the UK to get on track”.

The government has been criticised in recent weeks on similar grounds. Indeed, a CCC report published on 17 June stated that the UK was unprepared to deal with the changes that a warming climate will bring.

While the waning coronavirus pandemic has, quite understandably, forestalled certain actions, critics nonetheless argue that the government should take decisive steps to make up for lost time.

Moreover, the CCC also advises that the government should urge people to eat less meat, arguing that eating less meat is both good for the planet and good for an individual’s health.

People should eat 20 percent less meat by 2030 and 35 percent less meat by 2050, according to the CCC.

However, government ministers are understandably reluctant to promote such a message. With the UK-Australia trade deal already threatening UK farmers with further competition, encouraging the British public to purchase and consume fewer farm products would be politically challenging.

Rural farmers make up a key constituency in many Conservative seats across the home counties and further north. Further aggravating this key demographic would be seen as unwise by many in the cabinet.

The CCC does not only suggest that people eat less meat. The body suggests that sales of gas boilers should be banned by 2033, with customers encouraged to purchase heat pumps instead. Heat pumps, however, are more expensive to operate on average than gas boilers.

Furthermore, the CCC advocates for the reduction or removal of taxes on clean energy services and an increase in taxes on forms of power that significantly contribute to the increase of carbon.

Finally, the CCC mentions that individuals will need to take fewer flights in order for the UK as a whole to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050. The government does have plans for a net zero aviation strategy, but the CCC remains unconvinced that it would be sufficient, stating that the demand for flights cannot grow unconstrained.

With the 26th UN Climate Change Conference due to take place in Glasgow in early November, the UK is under pressure to produce specific plans to decarbonise across a variety of sectors.

But with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic producing mammoth levels of public debt and spending, the government also faces distinct economic pressures, and further constraints and regulations will slow the UK’s fiscal recovery over the coming years.
