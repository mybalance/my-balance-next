The UK’s Climate Change Committee, the CCC, has stated that the UK government must step up its plans if it is to reach 2030 emissions targets in a report released today.

While the UK does have one of the most ambitious 2030 plans, the policies required are not yet in place to achieve the government’s goals. 

The CCC report states that, at the moment, the UK will contribute to a temperature increase of 2.7 degrees by 2100.

And it goes without saying that many scientific climate models predict that warming of 2.7 degrees will have a variety of negative outcomes, to put things mildly, for the planet.

The UK government insists, of course, that it will meet its climate goals. 

In last week’s article, we mentioned a handful of climate experts who stated that the UK’s goals, and indeed the UK’s methods of getting there, were not up to the task. The CCC report doesn’t quite agree with this assessment. 

Rather, the CCC report argues that, while the UK’s policies certainly could be improved upon, actually delivering on one set of policies is better than not delivering on a stronger, more robust set of policies. 

The perfect, then, should not be the enemy of the good. 

In order to achieve these goals, the CCC recommends a variety of policies, one of which is the gradual phasing out of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.

This does beg the question: is there such a thing as an efficient subsidy for fossil fuels? That’s a question for another time. 

Politically, phasing out subsidies for fossil fuel companies could be quite tricky. While the policy itself would be popular with most of the electorate, it could lead to cost increases at the pump as the market finds a new equilibrium without government support. 

In the long term, removing these subsidies would arguably be better for both the consumer and the producers, but the short-term shock would be politically challenging for the government. 

What’s more, companies in this sector often have powerful lobby groups, meaning that changes in tax and subsidy policy are unlikely to go smoothly, even if the public would be widely in favour. 

But there is certainly money to be saved: the UK pays roughly £12.5 billion a year in subsidies to fossil fuel companies. 

Climate activists were understandably concerned with the CCC report. Greeenpeace director John Sauven argued that “for the committee to suggest it's okay for the UK to contribute to a temperature rise approaching 2C is outrageous. We know that a rise of 1.5C isn't safe; we're not even all safe now with a rise of 1.1C.” 

As with much of the promises made at COP26, only time will tell if world leaders are serious about lowering global temperatures.
