In the global race to net-zero carbon emissions, there is really only one major player. China is responsible for over a quarter of the world’s carbon emissions. 

This country of over 1.4 billion people produces roughly 2777 million tonnes of carbon each year. The next highest producer, the USA, produces roughly 1442 million tonnes of carbon each year. India, the world’s third highest producer, produces 714 millions tonnes each year.  

And while per capita carbon is less in China, the average Chinese citizen produces roughly half the amount of carbon than the average American citizen, China’s vast population more than makes up for this.

Moreover, reliance on coal power has increased slightly over the past few years. Like all countries, China uses energy from a variety of sources, but coal continues to be the energy source that the country relies on most heavily, with over 50 percent of its energy use coming from coal.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that coal use will begin to diminish from 2026 and President Xi has already pledged to stop building coal-fired power plants abroad. However, many observers of the Middle Kingdom argue that these commitments do not go nearly far enough.

The facts are clear. Without a significant reduction in carbon emissions from China, the world will be unable, practically speaking, to get emissions down to a sustainable level. 

We should remember, of course, that the economic growth that China has enjoyed over the past couple of decades has brought millions of Chinese citizens out of poverty. Indeed, these economic forces yielded the same results in India, Vietnam, and Botswana to name just a few. 

But there are no solutions; there are only trade-offs. 

And economic growth fueled by coal-powered power plants has significant downsides in terms of environmental cost. 

However, the outlook is not entirely negative. China does, for example, lead the world in wind power, with more than triple the number of sites than any other country last year.

And China does plan to produce a quarter of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

What’s more, the Chinese electric car market is moving in the right direction. China both makes and sells significantly more electric cars than any other country. While only 1 in 20 cars sold in China is electric, this will no doubt continue to increase as electric cars become cheaper and easier to produce. 

The upcoming COP26 event will give an indication of the way in which China intends to behave over the coming decade or so. It is certainly possible that China’s political class will look to make more steps towards a sustainable future, but they will have plenty of other concerns to consider as well.   

Reducing the carbon footprint of a country as vast and complex as China will not be easy, but, one way of the other, there isn’t much of an alternative if the world is going to meet its carbon targets.
