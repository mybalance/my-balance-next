It is a staggering figure that approximately 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted each year, that’s about 8% of the total CO2 we generate living on our planet, it’s nearly as much as the output from running our global transport network. Simply put this has to change.

If these global figures are a little tricky to digest (and excuse the pun) then in the UK alone we estimate that the cost of this waste exceeds £10.2 billion, or over £250 per household per year. We all know we need to act to reduce the harmful carbon but this area of waste food is a win-win where if we can get it worked out we save carbon and save cash from our pockets. 

Using these figures, if you want to look at it another way by removing the waste we all generate by throwing food away, we could make 8 meals per week, in a time where the cost of living is soaring, we have now there is no better time to start, so let's get going with some changes.

So where to start, well what better place than really starting to record what you waste, most of us have short term memories when it comes to what goes in our bins so why not start with a little waste food diary for a couple of weeks. A sheet of paper on the front of the fridge where we jot down what food we are throwing out. This needs to record not just the black bananas we did not eat or the past best date on the potatoes, it needs to record all food waste including what does not get eaten on the plate and goes into the bin. 

If we think about it more there are several reasons that food gets wasted whether that be our changing meal plans, buying what’s on offer at the shops because it's on offer, simple buying too much food or storage is not managed properly or we serve too much food or maybe we simply cook it poorly.

Finding out exactly what we waste as a household over say a few weeks will in most cases surprise us and, we hope, bring about a change in our food buying/cooking habits. We’ve set up a [weekly diary template](https://mybalance.earth/FoodWasteDiary.pdf) for you to copy or print off. If you decide to do things yourself then here are a few pointers as to what you should think about.

Daily list as a minimum, the type/name of the food. Was it spoiled, out of date (why you decided to throw it away, how much of it did you throw away)? Did it not turn out how you had hoped when you cooked it, simply too much on the plate, maybe you just fancied eating something else you never planned to eat. If you have a no-waste day then great record that too; it will help later when we look to change things. If you want to take it to another level then maybe add a note about the packaging, remembering that packaging has in most cases a large carbon element through the food chain. MyBalance will look at packaging further in one of our next articles, so at the moment it’s enough to just record whether packaged or not. 

So for the last few weeks, you have been looking to record the wasted food you put in the recycling bin, what’s next? Well now is the tricky part changing the habits that may have been with us for many years, but what you now have is the evidence in your hand of what really does not get used and quickly you can turn this into what it costs in both cash and carbon terms. 

A few pointers to get you going:

- Check what’s in your fridge, freezer, bread etc this may help stop buying from habit and buy what you don’t already have.
- Where you can try to plan meals rather than buying food that you bring together later in the week, it sounds simple but a simple meal planner should help and then make a list so you know when you have several other things going on exactly what you are planning to cook ad what you need to buy, it sounds simple and it is but don’t forget a lot of supermarkets are out to get you to buy what they want to sell and may through your list of course with ‘offers’. 
- Have a quick look at your food waste diary as you are about to start shopping try not to repeat what you did last week if that resulted in wasted meals, it’s hard to change habits and we need all the help we can.
- This may seem a strange one but try not to shop when you are hungry, most of us buy more food when we are in a hungry state so shop after you eat a meal where possible.

As we build our new habits MyBalance will help you along the way with tips and further news items that you may want to use to further reduce your food waste, these are great steps to lowering your carbon footprint and remember: it’s all about small steps that are added up together change your lifestyle. So take the challenge and start working out the areas of food waste in your home.
