While tensions exist between many different states across the globe, a new report from the National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change, a joint effort from America’s 18 intelligence agencies, argues that the planet’s changing climate will add yet more fuel to the fire of international tensions.

It’s not difficult to envisage a world with yet more uncooperative, combative leaders. The relationship between the US and China, two of the globe’s highest producers of carbon emissions, is already difficult for a wide variety of reasons, and yet more climate-related debate will only further pull at already-strained threads. 

Of course, there isn’t a practical alternative to China reducing its emissions, so these troublesome debates must go ahead.

What’s more, these global tensions will affect poorest countries the most, whose weaker economies render them more susceptible to changes in the climate. The report specifically identifies 11 countries particularly at risk from climate-related events. These are countries in which a heatwave or a drought could have serious negative effects on essential infrastructure such as the power grid. 

And while this report predicts further global tension, a recent study from Oxford university found that the language that we use to describe climate change is becoming more urgent. 

For example, between 2018 and 2020, the use of the term “climate crisis” increased almost 20-fold. 

Of course, language evolves all of the time, and the words and phrases that we use to describe the climate are no different. Back in the 80s, we were fond of the phrase “greenhouse effect”, but this was soon overtaken by the phrase “global warming”.

Whichever words we use to describe the effects that humanity has on the planet, both the US report and the Oxford study indicate that many individuals and institutions across the world are taking this issue much more seriously. 

Indeed, Trish Stewart, the science editor at the Oxford English Dictionary, said that “the very real sense of urgency that is now upon us is reflected in our language. What happens next depends on so many factors but, one thing we can be sure of is that our language will continue to evolve and to tell the story.”

The very real test of how seriously governments take climate change will soon begin. COP26 opens in a little over a week, and many world leaders will be seeking assurances from the countries that produce the most carbon that the current state of affairs will change. 

However, China’s Xi Jinping will not be easily swayed, no matter how urgent the language of Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Joe Biden, or dozens of other world leaders. 

In recent weeks, China has shown that it is willing to begin to cut back its vast emissions, And a report from America’s intelligence community and a study from Oxford university are unlikely to grease the wheels.
