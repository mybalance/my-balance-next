McDonald’s has opened its first net-zero restaurant in Market Drayton, Shropshire. Wind turbines and solar panels will provide the restaurant’s power. The building is clad with recycled computer equipment and old household goods and insulated with British sheep’s wool.

Indeed, this restaurant is the first in the UK to be verified by the UK Green Building Council as producing net-zero carbon emissions during its construction. 

While these materials are undoubtedly unusual, the building retains the feel of a modern McDonald’s location.  

Of course, the restaurant will offer the standard McDonald’s menu. 

Is this just a PR stunt, then? Or is McDonald’s committed to reducing its carbon footprint to net-zero?

There’s no doubt that building a carbon-neutral restaurant provides McDonald’s with ample opportunity to brandish its green credentials, but that doesn't mean that the corporation doesn’t also have ambitions when it comes to its carbon footprint.

Is the leadership team at Mcdonald’s committed to lowering global temperatures, or are they simply following the orthodoxy of the day? Readers should make up their own minds on this question. 

It is the case, however, that the fast food corporation has published net-zero targets that are readily available for anyone to view online. 

For example, one of McDonald’s goals is to “achieve net zero emissions for all of our restaurants and offices” by 2030.

What’s more, McDonald’s aims to “achieve net zero emissions for our entire business and value chain” by 2040. 

And building net-zero restaurants certainly aligns with these goals.  

Many green campaigners aren’t convinced, however. Anna Jones, from Greenpeace UK, criticised the corporation: “If meat and dairy are still the main course on McDonald's menu, then this new restaurant initiative can only be labelled as it is: McGreenwash.”

What’s more, Jennifer Jacquet, associate professor of environmental studies at New York University, said that “the issue is very clearly methane from the burgers sold at their 39,000 stores around the world.” 

While Mcdonald’s is set to release its first vegan burger in the coming few months, it’s highly unlikely that punters will be unable to purchase any of their signature burgers in the near future. 

But this new restaurant will be seen as a step in the right direction by many. Most normal people want to enjoy the occasional burger and leave a sustainable planet to their children, and McDonald’s -- in addition to most other big corporations across the world -- seem to agree with them.
