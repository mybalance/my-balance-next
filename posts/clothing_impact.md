Let’s start with a few published facts on the topic.

The fashion industry is responsible for around 6% of the annual global emissions when all the elements of production are added up (the data ranges from 2% to 10% in various studies).

Every year half a million tonnes of plastic microfibre are dumped into the sea – Microfibres mostly from the clothes we wear and our washing processes. If you have ever used a tumble dryer you know how quickly the filter can block.

Of all the fibres used in the production of clothing, a huge 87% is considered to end up in landfills.

And the estimates for the water used by the fashion industry in clothing production stand at 93 billion cubic meters. Enough water to support over five million people. 

Putting these figures in perspective, a pair of jeans needs about 3,000 litres during its production, and that’s the same as 33 kg of carbon emissions!

So if we ask the question again does my clothing have an impact, the answer is yes it can. The real question is then do I buy too much, do I buy the fashion of the month and do I look at the materials used? All these points make a big impact on your footprint. A generation or so ago we used our clothes until they were worn out, now we change them to follow fashion, something has changed and it’s not helping your carbon footprint. 

It’s not all doom and gloom, however. If you spend a few moments looking at the products before you buy you will see many brands now are changing the complete process from what materials they use, to how they make the clothing you wear and how it can be recycled after you have finished with it.

A great example of this is the recycling of plastics from our oceans scooped up by boats and made into shoes. By selecting which products you buy from companies that are making the change, you are sending a clear message to the clothing industry that you believe in what they are doing.

Is there anything I should start doing today?

- As mentioned above, the next time you need that new pair of jeans perhaps check the website of the company – what are their guiding principles? If they don’t publish it’s perhaps a question of whether they care. 
- Here is a quick look at fabric types in order of highest to lowest carbon footprint: wool, acrylic, viscose, cotton, silk, polyester, polyurethane and the best, flax linen. A word on flax linen, it has less than a third of the carbon footprint in production terms of wool and less than half acrylic and viscose.
- Wear clothes until they need replacing
- Avoid single-use clothing
- Repair or get somebody to help; it’s what we did for the last few thousand years.
- Do not stockpile clothing no matter how good the offer is, did you know 40% of clothing is never worn, a quick look in charity shops proves the point.
- Never throw away good clothes, donate to where they can be resold. Why not have a look around in these shops when you are there you will be surprised. 
- A golden rule here, buy quality over quantity where you can. I still have my 26-year-old outdoor coat and hope it has another 10 years of wear left. 
- Think about the damage washing and tumble drying can do to your clothes if not used properly

If you are wondering where to start, reviewing the companies you buy from you may wish to have a look at the statements from places like M&S and H&M. They have shown good carbon reduction leadership and you can start to follow and get ideas from those doing the most at the moment.
