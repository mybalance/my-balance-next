As COP26 enters its second week, a variety of important figures will continue to address the delegates, including former secretary-general of the UN Ban Ki-Moon and former US President Barack Obama.

Ki-Moon was straightforward in his analysis: “We have been failing the world and we have been failing the most vulnerable communities living on the front lines.”

Obama gave two speeches. He first spoke on a panel on island resilience. The former President was born in Hawaii, of course.

Obama next addressed the conference proper. Unsurprisingly, he received a rapturous welcome.    

He praised current US President Joe Biden’s efforts to mobilise both the public and the private sector in America in order to reach the US’s goals, saying that “the US is back.” Biden was Obama’s Vice President throughout his eight years in office.

He then went on to criticise China and Russia’s lack of urgency when it comes to the climate question, stating the two countries are not “as ambitious as they need to be.”

Neither China’s President Xi Jinping nor Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is attending COP26.  

America’s relationships with China and Russia aren’t stellar. This fact won’t surprise anyone. But the former President still chose to add a little more pressure to the absent leaders, a move which will likely draw more attention to both countries’ climate targets. 

Addressing the need for governments to promote climate-friendly policies, Obama urged voters across the world to “vote like your life depends on it because it does.”

He added that “the cold hard fact is we won't have more ambitious climate plans coming out of governments unless governments feel some pressure from voters.” 

Discussing individuals who disagree or challenge the accepted consensus on climate change, Obama said that “we can't just yell at them or say they’re ignorant.” Adding that, “ we have to listen to their objections."

Empathy is in short supply in modern politics -- on both sides of the Atlantic -- so Obama should be praised for this statement. It’s all too easy to demonise one’s political opponents, but such behaviour seldom achieves anything useful and usually increases the tension between individuals who disagree. 

Obama ended his speech on an upbeat note: “I’m ready for the long haul if you are, so let’s get to work.” 

And there is plenty more to do. World leaders must use the rest of their time at COP26 wisely, but these things aren’t easy. Our leaders should, as the former President says, be ready for the long haul.
