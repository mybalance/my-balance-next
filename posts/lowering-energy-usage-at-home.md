Lowering energy usage at home.

The increase in energy charges we are all facing is staggering – is there anything we can do to lower energy use, saving both money spent and carbon produced?

There are likely some things we can all do within our homes to reduce energy usage. We have pulled together a simple list below for you all to consider which areas you may be able to change. The good news is that if you have not already started taking action then there is perhaps a £200 a year saving for the average family, beyond that we can start to look at things like solar panels and local energy generation, which we will cover in a future update at MyBalance.

Keeping it simple to start with the following list would be a good place to start your energy reduction journey.

- Only use tumble driers on days when you can’t use a washing line.
- Turn off all appliances with a standby (in an average house this could be £50 p.a.).
- Turn off lights in rooms you are not using.
- Switch light bulbs to LED where you can, they can use 25% of normal bulbs.
- Run the washing machine at 30° where you can, and use the ECO setting.
- Take the 4-minute shower challenge, do you need to shower for 10 minutes?
- Never heat an empty home, seems common sense but what about not heating rooms you are not using, learn how to control your heating.
- There has never been a better time to start using your smart meter properly.
- Reduce heating water in the kitchen, fill only what you need in the kettle, and select the correct size pan for the food you are cooking.
- Slow cookers are very efficient, microwaves use 20% of the energy in a traditional cooker.
- Don’t leave phone chargers plugged in all the time; they use energy all the time they are plugged in.
- Keep that freezer defrosted, and don’t cram it too full as air won’t circulate correctly, using more energy.
- Perhaps check the loft space. Have you squashed all your insulation with boxes? Squashed insulation will not do its job correctly.
- A few pounds extra spent on A++ appliances when its time to renew will save you energy over the life of the appliance.

Going back to that smart meter, previous generations never had the oppotunity we all do now to monitor on a day to day basis exactly how much energy (and money) we are consuming in our homes. Try a 10% target reduction in daily energy use, it may take you some time but most families can achieve this sort of saving. This could in turn save you over £250 per year.
