This year’s World Environment Day takes place on 5 June. Hosted by Pakistan, the theme is ecosystem restoration.

While there will be some in-person events in Pakistan, many events will take place online, featuring speakers from a variety of sectors, from government ministers to leading climate scientists.

The theme of ecosystem restoration is encapsulated in #GenerationRestoration, proponents of which call for urgent action to revive ecosystems that have been damaged by human activity.

Take, for example, global deforestation.

While the rate of deforestation peaked in the 80s, we still lose over 4.7 million hectares of forests each year. That is an area roughly the size of Denmark. Or roughly one football pitch every three seconds.

What’s more, ecosystem and habitat loss robs the world of naturally occurring carbon sinks, and with global emissions continuing to rise, we can ill-afford to lose yet more natural sites that help in the fight against climate change.

There is no doubt that global ecosystem restoration is a significant challenge, but World Environment Day 2021 will see the launch of a new UN initiative, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which has the goals of preventing, halting, and reversing the degradation of ecosystems worldwide.

As the title suggests, this initiative aims to make the coming decade the most significant one yet in the fight against climate change.

Indeed, the initiative commits a variety of countries across the globe to restoring degraded land. The United Kingdom, for example, has committed to restore 381,000 hectares of land; the United States has committed to 15,000,000 hectares; Australia has committed to 60,100,000 hectares.

The initiative will focus on eight major types of ecosystems that have degraded: forests, oceans and coasts, urban areas, freshwater, peatlands, farmlands, mountains, grasslands and savannahs.

The restoration of forests, peatlands, and mangroves, for example, would mitigate the effects of over one third of the globe's greenhouse emissions by 2030.

Furthermore, restoring coastal wetlands on the Gulf Coast of the United States could avoid storm damage to the tune of 18 billion dollars by 2030.

The benefits of sensible, sustainable climate policy across the globe are clear, and #GenerationRestoration will hammer these benefits home during World Environment Day 2021 and beyond.

However, the scope of the problem that is our changing climate can often leave individuals feeling powerless. What can one person do in the face of such an overwhelming problem?

This would be an understandable response to such a critical issue, but there are nonetheless plenty of actions that individuals can take to do their part, from eating less meat and purchasing products from ethical sources to investing in carbon offsetting schemes.
