The Siberian town of Verkhoyansk, in Russia’s Sakha Republic, recently recorded the highest ever temperature in the Arctic, a balmy 38 degrees celsius.

The World Meteorological Society verified the record earlier this week. The temperature itself was recorded last year on 20 June. 

The temperature was 18 degrees warmer than the highest average temperature for that part of the world in June.   

The WMO secretary-general, professor Petteri Taalas, said that “this new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate.”

According to the WMO, the Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions in the world. Studies show that it warms at roughly twice the rate of the global average. 

Such warming has many negatives, of course, one of which is the thawing of the Arctic permafrost, which would then release more carbon and methane into the atmosphere, further contributing to the planet’s warming. 

Global warming begets global warming.   

Moreover, on the other side of the planet, one of the biggest glaciers in Antarctica, Thwaites Glacier, could “shatter like a car windscreen”, according to scientists who study the glacier. 

Professor Ted Scambos, of the the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, said that “there is going to be dramatic change in the front of the glacier, probably in less than a decade. Both published and unpublished studies point in that direction.”

Roughly the size of Florida, Thwaites is a vast glacier. If it were to break significantly the ice in its drainage basin would contribute to the increase of the height of the oceans. 

In lighter news, the glacier will in the New Year be studied by the infamous Boaty McBoatface, a British Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.

The vessel, named by the British public, will gather data on water temperature, direction, and turbulence. 

Godspeed.     

The gradually warming global climate, then, seems to be affecting both the Arctic and the Antarctic. 

While individual data points don’t necessarily point to drastic changes, in the aggregate, it’s not particularly surprising when scientists use phases like “sounding the alarm bells” when discussing these issues with the press. 

There’s no doubt that these issues will have been brought up and discussed at COP26, which means that the appropriate authorities are aware of the problems facing these parts of the world. 

But with ice continuing to thaw around both poles of the Earth, many climate activists will continue to highlight these issues across the globe.
