As part of our look at the carbon produced within the food chain, the team at MyBalance have been asked to write up a few words on growing at home and in doing so cutting out the carbon costs of transport and packaging which we all know is a major contributor to our food footprint.

When we start to take control of how and where our food is grown the likely impact is bigger than just the saving in carbon as we all start to become more aware of the food chain and seasonal food, plus we spend time outside so we have a win-win scenario! But where to start?

Setting up a veggie patch in your garden is the place where most of us start, have a quick look on YouTube; there is a fantastic range of help for us first-time growers. If space in the garden is not available then a windowsill makes a great first option to start a range of packaging-free herbs for a fraction of the shop cost. 

We have set out below a few thoughts to get you started on your journey, get the family involved if they are around you will be surprised at how much fun this can be.

1. A good place to start is thinking about what vegetables you buy from the shops regularly?  Don’t plant what you don’t enjoy, it sounds simple but keeps you invested.

2. Think about the seasons and the time to plant your new crop, as a first-time grower take advice on this as you will be surprised how things can change — the chance of frosts in the Northern counties of the UK extends a month beyond Devon. It's not difficult but important to follow the planting guidelines to avoid failure. 

3. If you don’t fancy growing seeds a trip to any garden centre will offer you trays of small plants that are ready to plant out in your garden, these seedlings may cost a little more than the seeds in a packet but they are ready to go. If you want to see some quick results maybe you can mix some Summer salad crop in with your autumn harvest, picking leaves as you go gets no fresher throughout the summer.

4. Some plants will give you a longer harvest window than others but generally, get yourself ready to pick throughout the year (e.g. as your tomatoes turn red), and prepare some storage for your root crops. Potatoes are a great long term option if you have the space to store them correctly.

All your efforts will be rewarded at so many levels, you will reduce your carbon footprint, and you should save significant cash. Hopefully, it's a family project for you all to have fun with and importantly you should taste the difference.

Good luck with your growing, and have fun!
