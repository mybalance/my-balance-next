What has happened in the low-carbon world since COP26? While the conference yielded some promising agreements -- from agreements on deforestation to methane reduction -- there are nonetheless significant hurdles that must be overcome if the globe is going to keep warming to manageable levels.  

Indeed, scientists who recently spoke to the BBC were pessimistic that the politicians who made the promises in question would actually keep them. What’s more, they agreed that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was not ambitious enough. 

Professor Piers Forster, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that “1.5 has become the talisman for the safest we can hope for this century. But the more we learn the more we realise there is no safe limit.”

Professor Tim Lenton, from the Global Systems Institute, added that “we are still heading for more than 2°C of global warming, which risks triggering multiple climate tipping points.”

A climate tipping point is a state in which a negative climate outcome is inevitable. While some climate tipping points are already baked into the system, we still have time to avoid many of the more dangerous climate events across the world. 

It’s fair to say, then, that there’s plenty more to be done. 

But with COP26 over, many climate analysts will be sceptical that anything more significant can be achieved in the near future. The conference was seen by many influential observers as our last real chance to agree on meaningful, lasting change.

And with China and India forcing a change in the language of an agreement on coal -- “phased out” to “phased down” -- it’s understandable that many scientists believe that COP26 was somewhat disappointing. 

New Delhi and Beijing undoubtedly want to continue to reap the benefits of fossil fuels. The huge reductions in poverty in India and China were, and continue to be, driven by these countries liberating their internal markets and embracing global trade. Cheap, readily available energy in the form of fossil fuels was a huge driver of this progress.

The political class in India and China will want to keep this process going for as long as possible. The change in language clearly indicates as much.

Boris Johnson was optimistic at a recent talk, however. COP26, Johnson argued, sounds “the death knell for coal power”. 

The PM is well-known for his linguistic embellishments, so it’s tricky to discern how sincere he is in this pronouncement. He is certainly aware that the summit had both its positive and negative elements, and it’s possible that he is putting a favourable spin on a conference that had mixed results.

It’s too soon to tell whether COP26 was a failure or a success. Given some time and some context, it’ll probably be seen as a bit of both, which is certainly much better than many people were expecting a few weeks ago.
