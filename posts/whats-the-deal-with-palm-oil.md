Palm oil is a vegetable oil that across the world is used in just about everything, from ice cream to lipstick! Nearly 70 million tonnes of the stuff is produced each year, with around 85% coming from Indonesia and Malaysia. Oil palm trees are native to Africa but were brought to South-East Asia in the early 1900s.

The problem with palm oil is that its cultivation has a devastating impact on the environment. Huge swathes of rainforest have been bulldozed across South-East Asia to make way for palm oil plantations. These rainforests are a key part of our global ecosystem, with several already endangered species, such as the Orangutan and Sumatran rhino, calling them home. Losing these forests is bad enough, but what makes things worse is the fact that the soil in these areas acts as a carbon sink, so their conversion to plantations, coupled with the loss of rainforests, releases enormous amounts of greenhouse gases. Additionally, it has been widely documented that exploitation of workers and child labour occurs in the industry.

Itâ€™s not all bad news though - when farmed sustainably palm oil can be an extremely efficient crop, and contribute positively to the economies of emerging countries. Organisations such as the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil develop standards for palm oil production to help companies grow and use it sustainably. In the UK, the government has set a target for 100% of the palm oil used to be from sustainable sources and has made great progress towards this goal, but as always there is more to be done.
