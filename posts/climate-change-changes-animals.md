Since around the 1850s, the planet has warmed by roughly 1.5 degrees celsius. If the planet continues to warm, which it most likely will, we will see changes not only to the environment itself but also the animals that live in it. 

Indeed, a recent study in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution discusses the change that the warming climate has on wildlife around the world. While climate change isn’t the only cause of these changes, it is certainly a piece of the puzzle.

The study suggests that, in order to remain cool, warm-blooded animals are evolving to have larger beaks, legs and ears.

For example, many species of Australian parrot have, since 1871, shown an increase in bill size of between four and ten percent.

These changes are relatively modest, but as the planet continues to warm these changes could become more significant. Indeed, this year has seen some of the highest temperatures in decades, and July was the world’s hottest month on record. 

What’s more, these adaptations remind us that humans aren’t the only species on the planet who must adjust our behaviour to climate change. And while we have a remarkable ability to adapt to our surroundings, not all animal species share this talent. 

Put simply, we must steward the planet not just for ourselves, but for all life that inhabits it.

However, the warming climate is responsible for more than larger appendages in warm-blooded animals. 

Green turtles, for example, are affected by the increased temperatures. The sex of a baby green turtle is dertermined by the temperature of the sand in which the egg is laid. Temperatures of over 29.1 degrees celsius produce females; cooler temperatures produce males.

A study of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef found that almost all green sea turtle offspring were born female, with males outnumbered over 100 to 1. If left unchecked, the consequences of this problem for future green turtle populations are dire.

All is not lost, however. Researchers at the University of Queensland have come up with innovative ways to keep the sand cool, from employing natural and artificial shade to seawater irrigation. The results are positive: eggs from the cooler sands produced more male hatchings. 

This research goes to show that, while our species has had negative effects on the planet, human action against the warming climate can yield positive results. We shouldn’t be complacent, of course. There is still much work to be done towards a sustainable future for both humans and animals alike.
