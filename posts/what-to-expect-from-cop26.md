COP26 begins this Sunday, and the eyes of the world will be on the heads of state that arrive in Glasgow to discuss the many issues around climate change. 

What can we expect from the conference? Put simply, it’s tricky to say. Are we likely to see harmonious cooperation between nations? Certainly not. But are we likely to see fracuous and entirely unhelpful arguments for two weeks? That’s unlikely as well.

The truth, as ever, is somewhere in between.

Leaders are going to have to compromise. Indeed, the people in positions of power would do well to remember that the perfect shouldn’t be the enemy of the good. Some concessions are better than no concessions at all. 

And most people are familiar with the countries that must make the most sacrifices in order to keep the world cool. China, the USA, and India are the three countries at the top of the pile when it comes to carbon emissions. 

What can COP26 expect from America? US President Joe Biden is under significant pressure back home to pass large spending and infrastructure bills, and with a razor-thin majority in both houses of Congress, Biden’s path to securing the votes that he needs isn’t simple. 

Regardless, certain elements of his party will expect Biden to drive home the need to reduce global temperatures over the coming years at COP26, and these elements will expect the President to be a forceful advocate of their position. 

China’s President Xi Jinping will be under a different kind of pressure; it will be external rather than internal. 

Many world leaders will pressure China to take further steps in reducing its carbon emissions. After all, without change in China, there’s little that can be done to combat climate change. 

And India’s emissions are another question as well. In an interview on Wednesday discussing India’s commitments to net-zero, India’s environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, said that “it is how much carbon you are going to put in the atmosphere before reaching net-zero that is more important.”

What’s more, he added that rich countries needed to acknowledge their “historic responsibility” for carbon emissions. 

Of course, Yadav is correct to point out that rich nations are responsible for much of the carbon that has already been released into the atmosphere. What’s more, it’s entirely understandable that developing nations would want to use the most efficient fuel possible to bring their standard of living up to that of Western nations.

And this is one of the many reasons that make climate agreements so difficult, and COP26 will be no different. Developing nations need to become developed nations, and fossil fuels can of course be a very useful stepping stone to get there. 

Nations that have already used this stepping stone will have a very difficult time advising developing nations to use less efficient sources of power that will keep their people poorer for longer. 

This thorny issue is only one of the problems that will confront the delegates at COP26.
