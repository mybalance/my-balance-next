Since leaving the EU, the UK is no longer subject to the Common Agricultural Policy. The CAP is a broad range of rules and directives that governs farming in the EU. Most notably for British farmers, the CAP granted subsidies based on, broadly speaking, the amount of land that they farmed.

UK farmers are no longer subject to the CAP, and, therefore, will not receive government subsidies.

At least, farmers won’t receive EU government subsidies. The UK government intends to continue to support farmers to one degree or another.

Indeed, under new plans, the UK government will reward farmers based on how they use their land to care for the environment.

These new plans will incentivise farmers to rewild the land or use it for carbon sequestration or flood prevention projects.

Michael Gove, the former Environment Secretary, coined the term “public money for public goods” a few years back, implying that farmers should get paid only if they provide a service for the public.

The definition of a “public good” is, of course, at least somewhat ambiguous, but these new plans would indicate that the government sees environmental gains as an asset to which the public will contribute in the form of subsidies to farmers.

The current Environment Secretary, George Eustice, highlighted the need for both environmental protection and secure food production, saying that "we can have both sustainable, profitable food production, and see a recovery for nature as well”.

However, not all farmers are content with the new arrangements. James Rebanks, a farmer and a best-selling author, argues that the subsidies are a distraction.

Talking to the BBC, Rebanks stated that the government intends to deregulate the market.

"What this is really about is the deregulation of agriculture and the environment, the liberalisation of trade policies", Rebanks said.
He added that the government was offering “bits of wilderness” to “buy us off”.

This government doesn’t have much of a track record when it comes to liberalisation, but the actual effects of these policies remains to be seen.

Dr Alexander Less of Manchester Metropolitan University, again talking to the BBC, commented on the issue of biodiversity. "It would seem very hard to reverse biodiversity loss for the most threatened species in just 10,000 hectares”.

"If we are serious, then we need to be racing towards the 300,000 hectare target as fast as possible," Lees added.

The issue of farming has often been a tricky issue for the government. With the state supporting the sector, any change to farm subsidies will be greatly scrutinised, and the opposition benches will often have much ammunition with which to criticise.

For example, any subsidy reductions – regardless of their benefits and drawbacks – will draw harsh criticism.

Farmers, what’s more, are a powerful constituency, making any changes to farm policies all the more difficult.

How the proposed rules will play out politically and environmentally remains to be seen.
