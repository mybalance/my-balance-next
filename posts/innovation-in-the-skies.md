The Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, recently announced that her government would make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 

The goal, declared in Frederiksen’s New Year address, is a difficult one. The PM admitted that the technology required to meet such a lofty ambition was not currently available.

The Danish government also plans to reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 70 percent compared to 1990 levels. 

Of course, the Danes aren’t alone in their climate goals. Back in April 2021, the French government moved to completely ban domestic short-haul flights where the same journey could be made by rail in two-and-a-half hours or less.

What’s more, the Austrian government replaced internal flights between Vienna and Salzburg with more train services between the two cities. 

Many of our continental friends, then, are taking their climate commitments seriously, with domestic airlines obliged to make changes. 

But the Danes, instead of banning flights, look instead to technology and innovation to bring down the carbon footprint of flying.

Indeed, Airbus, a European aerospace corporation, recently announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be in the air by 2035.

Airbus isn’t the first company to express an interest in hydrogen-fuelled planes. ZeroAvia, a startup based in California, completed a short hop in a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft back in the summer of 2020. 

The aircraft, HyFlyer 1, is a Piper M-Class, which seats six people. This plucky little plane, then, isn’t the solution to the problem of carbon in the aviation industry, but it is a step in the right direction. 

And it is a step that many climate experts say should happen. The commercial aviation industry produces roughly 2.5 percent of global carbon emissions, and while carbon per flight has decreased by over 50 percent since 1990, the overall number of flights has significantly increased. 

Passenger numbers are predicted to double by 2037, and by 2050 it is predicted that over 10 billion people per year will take a flight. 

Demand for flights, then, isn’t going anywhere, which means that the industry has little choice but to become more sustainable. 

What’s more, this ever-increasing demand would indicate that the solution to the problem of carbon in aviation is to be found in innovation. While replacing shorter domestic flights with rail services does have its benefits, it’s clearly not a long-term solution to this problem. 

In principle, the Danes have the right idea. Innovation beats restriction. But only time will tell whether Frederiksen’s 2030 goal is too ambitious. 

The Danish Prime Minister certainly understands the importance of flight. Announcing the 2030 goal, Frederiksen said this: “To travel is to live and therefore we fly”.  

Clearly, most of the rest of the world agrees.
