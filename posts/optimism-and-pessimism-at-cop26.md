2.7 degrees of warming by the end of this century would be a “climate catastrophe”, according to the UN. 

But that’s exactly where we’re heading at the moment. 

COP26, which kicks off in Glasgow today, is humanity’s best hope of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees this century. 

While many writers and critics say that such language is unhelpful and overblown, expect to hear much more of it over the coming couple of weeks. The great and the good are in Glasgow to discuss the climate, and most will have strong words for the global community.

Boris Johnson gave the first speech of the conference, and while the British PM is known for a colourful turn of phrase, he was in slightly more serious form today.

However, Johnson did reference Michael Dobbs’ famous book on the Cold War, when the West and the Soviet Union were seemingly moments away from global annihilation: ”Humanity has long since rundown the clock on climate change; it is one minute to midnight on that clock and we need to act now.”

This analogy certainly set the tone for the rest of the speakers. 

Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, didn’t at all mince his words in his speech: “Either we stop it or it stops us. And it's time to say, enough. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.”

Guterres clearly wants the delegates in Glasgow and the watching public to know that he is serious about the threat of climate change, and he is in good company. The speaker that followed him, Prince Charles, certainly echoed the sentiment. 

The Prince of Wales said that “We have to reduce emissions urgently and take action to tackle the carbon already in the atmosphere.” He also added that “time has quite literally run out.”

But it wasn’t all doom and gloom. In his speech, Sir David Attenborough stated that humans are the greatest problem solvers on earth, adding that “in my lifetime I've witnessed a terrible decline. In yours you could, and should, see a wonderful recovery.”

There is no doubt that over the course of Attenborough’s 95-year life -- long may it continue -- human action has affected the climate and warmed the planet. However, we should also note the incredible rise in living standards that we have seen throughout that period. 

Indeed, human action brings roughly 130,000 thousand people out of poverty everyday, and it is that fact that policy makers must balance against calls to halt global warming. There are sensible, appropriate measure to take against climate change that do not stop the march of progress into the 21st century.
