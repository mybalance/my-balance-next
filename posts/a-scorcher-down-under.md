After the EU reports that the past seven years have been the hottest on record, our Australian friends equalled their hottest day on record, a scorching 50.7 degrees celsius. 

The record was first set in 1962 in South Australia, and it was matched this week in Onslow, Western Australia, way out in the Pilbara.  

Onslow is a small, remote coastal town with a population of 848. It sits 861 miles north of Perth, the capital of Western Australia.

The average temperature in Onslow at this time of the year is just over 35 degrees. 

And while 35 degrees is a warm day in virtually anyone’s book, 50.7 degrees really takes the cake. 

Indeed, when temperatures start getting that high, basic infrastructure can begin to break down.

Talking to ABC news, a local resident said that the air conditioning at his office had stopped working. The resident, Mark Barratt, said that “things are starting to feel the stress. That’s for sure.”

Nature, it seems, isn’t without a sense of irony. 

And it’s not just the Aussies who are feeling the heat. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, the EU reports that the past seven years have been the warmest on record. 

The Copernicus Climate Change Service – which takes data from Sentinel satellites in the Earth’s orbit, as well as data collected on the ground – stated that 2021 was the fifth-hottest year on record, with multiple heat records broken across the globe.

On the BBC, Climate editor Justin Rowlatt writes that these temperatures “measure out the pace of change in our world. The increments may be tiny – a fraction of a degree – but the direction of travel is inescapable.” 

Readers might remember the heat back in the summer months. Early- and mid-thirties heat is no joke in a country with very little air conditioning in homes. 

And on the Mediterranean things got even hotter. In Sicily, an overwhelming 48.8 degrees was reported, which breaks Europe’s record for highest temperature by .8 degrees.

What’s more, 2021 saw wildfires and floods on the continent, with blazes in Italy and Greece and flooding in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. 

While climate change doesn’t bear the entire responsibility for these problems, there are good arguments to suggest that it is a significant part of the problem. 

This sentiment was summed up by Carlo Buontempo, the Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, who said that "these events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society, and work towards reducing net carbon emissions".

And he’s very probably correct.
