Saudi Arabia has rejected calls to phase out the use of fossil fuels.

This won’t be particularly surprising to many casual observers of global politics and climate negotiations. Over half of the Kingdom’s revenues come from oil exports. 

The old adage certainly applies here: money talks. 

However, the Saudis did present a plan last month in which the country would move to net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. 

But in the short- to medium-term, both China and India will remain customers as these states continue to modernise, largely using fossil fuels to do so.

Which brings to one of the more difficult aspects of the modern climate debate. Western nations relied on fossil fuels to reach the standard of living that we enjoy today. To pull up the ladder behind us seems at least somewhat hypocritical.

China and India -- and many other states -- will want to continue to use Saudi oil to enrich their nations and increase their standard of living. 

From this perspective, Riyadh’s actions are entirely understandable. There are simply not enough incentives for the Saudi’s to change track any time soon.

It should be noted, however, that Saudi officials call the claims that the oil-rich state is blocking a deal “a cheat and a lie”.

COP26 was certainly not going to be plain sailing, and this will be undoubtedly one of many roadblocks that negotiators must deal with. 

Negotiators, what’s more, will have expected Saudi resistance. A document that was leaked last month revealed that Saudi Arabia was lobbying the UN to amend a key report ahead of the conference. 

Japan and Australia, among other nations, were also mentioned in the document. 

The report strongly stated the need to move away from fossil fuels in the near future.

The people that make the key decisions in any government are just that, people. And people, regardless of the institution, are subject to incentives. Countries that significantly rely on fossil fuels for their prosperity are unlikely to move away from fossil fuels in a hurry. 

Indeed, until a reliable alternative is found, these states, and the people who lead them, will likely continue to do that which they have always done. 

It’s no surprise that neither China’s Xi Jinping or Russia’s Vladimir Putin is at COP26. Russia and China have little incentive to change track at the moment. 

And it’s no surprise that the Saudi’s continue to be reluctant to change. 

However, there are a couple more days of negotiations to go, which means that yet more agreements could emerge from the conference. 

We’ll have to wait for the final accords, and negotiators know who is reluctant to change and who can be convinced, which means that there is hope yet for better agreements to emerge from COP26.
