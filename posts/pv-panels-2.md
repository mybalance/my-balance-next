Before we go into the detail let's have a quick look at the technology and see how solar systems work and then will they work for you. 

So solar photovoltaic (PV) panels produce electricity for you to use in your home directly from the most powerful energy source we know, the Sun. These systems are made of semiconductors such as silicon which absorb light and convert it to electricity, it's important to understand that it's the light and not the sun's heat that generates electricity. These solar cells are packed together in a panel. A series of panels are connected together (normally between 8 to 14 panels) which feeds into a box (the inverter) which converts the electricity to mains value 240v.

From the above system, you can either use the energy as it is generated or seek to store the energy in a battery pack similar to that in an electric car for use when you need it. The only issue is that the batteries are currently quite pricey, we hope these prices will drop as the technology in battery use improves in future years, if you have the cash now then yes they can work for you.

The first question normally asked is can a solar system be effective in the UK, the clear answer is yes they are very efficient. Remember it's not the heat from the sun it's the daylight that generates the energy so things will change on cloudy days but the UK has good records of strong sunlight to produce strong solar output. You can expect to generate twice as much energy in the spring/summer/autumn months as the short winter ones.

The lifespan of a modern PV system should be 25yrs so your investment should be considered as one that generates a long-term gain, to make things work efficiently you will need a system of at least 8 panels, better if you can accommodate 14. In total thatâ€™s quite a big roof area that needs to face south and at a pitch (angle) of around 30 degrees free from shadows etc, not everybody's roof works so the first steps are likely to think about where might work then get a survey completed. 

Using the pre-2022 price increase in electricity from your supplier a new system of say 4kw could take 15 years to pay back, that changed to closer to 10 yrs with the first set of increases and now we know things will rise again in the autumn, likely bringing the financials to a figure below 7 yrs. This in effect means your system is generating say 18 yrs of electricity at zero cost to you after your initial costs are repaid in a fairly short period. 

Covering the financials is one thing and they need to make sense, but perhaps the greatest achievement for you is the absolute outcome of carbon-free energy generation for your home. Cutting your carbon footprint for the next 25 yrs is a real achievement, this is estimated at around 1 tonne per year. Further down the road you can add to your system, use batteries and add further home generation. 

There will always be the need to consider the issues if you live in rented accommodation as your landlord will need to give approval, if you own your home in some conservation areas or live in a listed building you likely will need to check with your local authority.

There are plenty of companies now in the UK that will provide free surveys and estimates for you if you are considering these options, a quick Google search will show you who is around. 

Now may be the time to take a serious look at solar generation and save both cash from your pocket and significant carbon reduction.
