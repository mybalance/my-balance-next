The UK will host the 47th G7 summit, which will take place in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, from the 11th to the 13th of June.

The G7 -- the Group of Seven -- is an intergovernmental organisation made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The leaders of the G7 are expected to be joined by Australia’s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, South Korea’s President, Moon Jae-in, and South Africa’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa.

Representing nearly 60 percent of global net wealth and more than 45 percent of global gross domestic product, the G7 holds significant political and cultural influence.

The expected agenda for this year’s summit is no surprise. With much of the globe’s population still dealing with the threat of Covid-19, the G7’s response to the pandemic will take center stage.

However, climate change is also likely to take up a significant amount of time on the agenda, and with the COP26 summit, to be hosted in Glasgow, approaching in November, the UK will be keen to flex its green credentials.

Indeed, this G7 summit is set to be carbon neutral, with four global carbon offsetting projects announced by the PM earlier in May.

What’s more, the summit is organised with sustainability in mind. The government’s G7 site states that the summit will: “include a heavy emphasis on local and seasonal produce in the catering, with priority given to sourcing produce and goods within 100 miles of Carbis Bay”.

Moreover, local Cornish companies have been commissioned to sustainably produce much of the products that the G7 leaders will use at the summit, including recycled stationary and natural soap.

Finally, event organisers are working to “ensure the summit is free from single-use plastic wherever possible”.

The PM will no doubt be keen to emphasise the British government’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 68 percent by the end of the decade, putting the UK on the path to net zero emissions by 2050.

Indeed, this commitment would reduce the UK’s emissions faster than any other major global economy.

However, despite these commitments, Devon and Cornwall Police is expecting protests, and while four protest sites have been approved, the force said that it was “not naive enough” to expect all protests to take place at these sites. The protest group Extinction Rebellion is planning a “series of COVID-safe, nonviolent mass participation actions across mid-Cornwall”.

At the 2019 summit in Biarritz, France, French police used tear gas to disperse violent protests in Bayonne, a nearby City.

The 2020 summit, which was due to be hosted at Camp David in the United States, was of course cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.

Whatever the outcome of this summit, individuals aren’t powerless, and small steps can lead to big progress.

And while MyBalance users don’t have the influence of a global intergovernmental organisation, there are nonetheless plenty of actions that we can take in order to mitigate our personal effects on the planet.
