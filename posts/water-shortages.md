Things are very clearly changing in some parts of the world as we experience huge changes in our weather, most scientists agree it's a result of climate change. The result we are experiencing is causing floods in some countries while others dry up, we have set out in this news briefing some of the changes being experienced on the west coast of the United States, where the impact is now breaking all records that have gone before.

The United States' largest water reservoir feeds the Hoover dam through a number of linked lakes and rivers, when the Hoover dam was created in 1931 it took 7 years to fill up the reservoir naturally and has been supplying thousands of homes every since. However, the last time the reservoir was full was over 20 years ago, and today it is measuring just 25% of full capacity, Lake Mead is at its lowest ever level. 

It's more than just the largest reservoir in the U.S., the hydroelectric power generated from the Hoover dam with its 17 generators has a massive capacity of over 2,000 megawatts of green electricity, providing for 1.3m people in 3 states adjacent to the dam. A true long-term green energy solution is now under pressure as water levels drop to critical, in mid-July 2022 the water level was a meagre 1,041 feet, the reason this is important is that at 1,000 feet the Hoover dams ability to generate electricity is affected. 

This long-term drought has really sucked the water out of the systems designed to store it, and now with questions about the dam not generating electricity if things continue this way in the next year or so things are not looking great. In addition to the electricity generated over 40 million people in the southwestern states obtain water from these systems, more than 80% of western US states are abnormally dry with well over a third now recorded as being extreme or exceptional drought.

The recently published united nations climate change report found that climate change is supercharging the water cycle changes fuelling more droughts and extreme weather events. The state governor is now moving to restrict water supply in some areas, whilst buying future energy to avoid the potential of blackouts forecast from late 2022. This has the potential to be bad news as these alternative energy sources are made up of much higher levels of fossil fuels, the burning of which has in part caused the problem of climate change in the first place. 

It is estimated that these droughts are causing an increase in harmful carbon dioxide from alternative power generation by much as 10% above previous levels. This in turn is driving more climate change and more drought, the answer in part has been a move to provide more solar and wind power generation. 

Through this drought there is a chance this part of the U.S. will end up with a robust multi-generation platform for sustainable energy, we are clearly still learning what impact climate change is having on our world.
