As COP26 comes to a close, we can end with some good news. America and China have agreed to increase their cooperation on climate issues. 

Both states will “recall their firm commitment to work together” in order to bring warming down to manageable levels. 

It’s fair to say, however, that this is quite vague language. Will this new accord change things on the ground? Will these two great adversaries take concrete steps towards net-zero?

That remains to be seen. 

The Chinese climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said that “both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris agreement goals”, adding that “climate change is becoming an increasingly urgent challenge”.

The US climate envoy, John Kerry, was similarly upbeat: “This is a roadmap for our countries and future collaboration. China and the US have no shortage of differences. But cooperation is the only way to get this job done”.

Kerry added: “This declaration is a step that we can build on to close the gap”. The gap, of course, refers to the remaining emissions to be cut in order to reach warming targets. 

We’ve said it before on this blog, and many commentators in the climate space have said it as well, but without China making changes, keeping warming to 1.5 degrees is very unlikely to happen. 

That China is at least willing to enter into talks with the US certainly qualifies as a step in the right direction. 

The deal aims for more regulations in order to further decarbonise, reduce methane emissions, and fight deforestation.

But some experts remain sceptical.

Byford Tsang, a policy analyst at E3G, said that “it’s a good sign that the world’s two biggest emitters can actually work together to face the biggest crisis of humanity but there’s not a lot of meat there after the methane stuff”. 

Bernice Lee, research director at Chatham house, added that “details remain patchy”.

These criticisms are appropriate, but we should also keep in mind that the US and China are global adversaries, and while US rhetoric against China has softened slightly since Biden’s election, there are still plenty of tensions between the two states. 

Any agreement, then, is both unexpected and welcome. 

Time will tell whether it -- and the other agreements that COP26 has yielded -- will be enough to keep the planet at a manageable level of warming. 

Indeed, time will tell whether the delegates at COP26 actually achieved anything of value. Words on paper are one thing; actions are something else entirely. 

Most world leaders know this, and the issue of climate is unlikely to go away anytime soon, which means that pressure from both the public and the media will continue to mount.
