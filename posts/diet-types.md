There is so much published data telling us that a meat-based diet has a high carbon footprint, but that is not to say we all must stop eating meat as it’s part of many of our balanced diets. Some of us may wish to consider some changes and even small changes will have a positive impact. When you first completed your carbon footprint assessment using the MyBalance app you may have noticed the impact of meat-based diets, in some cases increasing your footprint by over 2 tonnes against somebody who eats no meat. 

We live in times with plenty of labels for most things, some easy to understand and some less so, and these labels might change as time moves forward. We have set out below a short summary of the common low carbon diet types that many people relate to currently. You may find you don’t fit into a particular group or you change groups depending on how you are feeling or the time of the year. There is no need to fit any group but hopefully, you can get an idea of how some people are trying to structure their diets.

- Vegan: this would involve not eating any animal products in any form. So no meat, seafood, or diary – keeping it simple.
- Vegetarian: no meat at all, but some animal products such as dairy, eggs, and honey along with a full range of plant-based foods.
- Plant-based: predominantly plant and fruits with an emphasis on unprocessed foods
- Reducetarian: based on a significant reduction of meat and dairy in all diets, with individuals having the choice to make the best changes they can to reduce these high carbon practices around meat production.
Flexitarian: with an overall goal to reduce meat and dairy but on occasions minimal meat meals are considered OK, the majority of the diet will be plant-based nutrition.
- Climatarian: the decision on what you eat is based on the carbon footprint of the food, typically meat reduction features highly along with processed foods such as cheese, in some cases, food travel and packaging can feature. 

Did you know that many of the ancient gladiators who fought for the Romans thousands of years ago were known as “hordearii’ or barley eaters? Today this is interpreted as many being early adopters of vegetarian diets
