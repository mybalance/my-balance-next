Deforestation is an important factor in the planet’s warming climate.

Since 1990, we have lost over 420 million hectares of forest, an area roughly the size of South Africa.

If deforestation were a country, it would come in only behind China and the USA for its carbon-equivalent emissions.   

Rates of deforestation have been slowing over the past decade or so. In 1990, 16 million hectares of forest were lost to deforestation efforts; last year, this figure was roughly 10 million hectares.

However, many scientists and activists argue that this rate remains too high, and deforestation has started to tick up in some important parts of the world, including the Amazon in Brazil, with deforestation rates this past year the highest in a decade.

The main driver of deforestation is agricultural expansion, which, of course, does have its benefits. Farmers who owe their employment and livelihood to land that has been deforested are an important part of this conversation. Indeed, the world needs food.

But everything comes at a cost. And the value of forests for the health of the planet can’t be understated.

Trees and plants absorb roughly a third of carbon emissions from the atmosphere each year. As deforestation continues, then, the planet gradually becomes less and less effective at removing harmful emissions and maintaining a sustainable temperature.

What’s more, the loss of tree cover across the world has been linked to the increasingly volatile weather events that we have seen over the past few years.

The effects of deforestation can be felt in a variety of communities, from those close to the forests to those much further afield. The Amazon, for example, is a key factor in the water supply of Brazilian cities, as well as neighbouring countries.

The effects could even be felt by coffee drinkers, as wild coffee species have a significant chance of going extinct, at least in part due to deforestation.

While the subject of deforestation can often be disheartening, there are some causes for hope and optimism. 

For example, residents of Kokota, a small Tanzanian island, have planted more than 2 million trees over the past decade in an effort to repair previous damage.

Or consider Topher White at National Geographic, who has discovered a way to use recycled mobile phones to monitor for chainsaws -- chainsaws that would, of course, potentially be used to illegally fell trees.

As I noted at the beginning of this article, rates of deforestation are slowing around the world, and, as lower- and middle-income countries continue to grow more prosperous, this trend is likely to continue.

There is much to be done, of course, and we shouldn’t be complacent, but there is certainly reason for optimism.
