On 16 June, the Climate Change Committee, the UK’s independent advisory body on the issue of climate change, released a report detailing the UK’s preparedness for the potential changes that climate change will bring.

The report runs to more than 1,500 pages, drawing on analysis from over 450 expert individuals and 130 organisations in the field of climate research.

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK Government is required to publish a climate change risk assessment every five years. This document sets out both the risks and opportunities that climate change poses to the UK.

Some of the effects of the changing climate cannot be avoided, but the effects of climate change to the UK in the second half of this century can be mitigated with sensible, thoughtful policy -- both in the UK and across the globe.

What is the main takeaway from the report? Put simply, the CCC argues that the UK is underprepared for the challenges of climate change. What’s more, the CCC states that the UK is worse prepared now than it was five years ago, when the previous report was commissioned.

Specifically, the report highlights the increased risk of severe heatwaves and more intense rainfall, leading to a significantly increased risk of flooding throughout most of the UK.

Indeed, the report makes clear the need for UK homes and infrastructure to be made more resilient to these changes, with new builds and coming infrastructure projects to have climate protections at the core of their design.

For example, with rising temperatures -- especially in cities -- causing flats to be warmer, the report suggests that the government ought to oblige landlords to install sunshades in order to keep flats cool during the summer months.

Many of the members of the CCC have expressed frustration at the UK government’s perceived lack of action on the issue of climate. The committee’s chief executive, Chris Stark, told the BBC that the commission had deliberately made the report “spiky” in order to best communicate the problems that the commission found.

Continues Stark, “It's really troubling how little attention the government has paid to this. The extent of planning for many of the risks is really shocking. We are not thinking clearly about what lies ahead.”

Talking to the BBC, a government spokesman replied, saying that “The UK was the first major world economy to set a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our plan to further reduce emissions in 2035 by at least 78% compared to 1990 levels is the highest reduction target by a major economy to date.

“We welcome this report and will consider its recommendations closely as we continue to demonstrate global leadership on climate change ahead of COP26 in November.”

With many organisations and experts in the field of climate research -- not to mention opposition politicians -- urging the government to take more steps to combat climate change, the current administration is under pressure to further prove its green credentials.

Indeed, this report will not make pleasant reading for government officials.
